# central_auth

## Overview

Module manages authentication to a centralised authentication system. It currently supports connection to
Active Directory and openLDAP from Red Hat, Suse, and Debian based systems.  It will use SSSD and 
associated services when available, but will use LDAP direct when SSSD is not available.
